<H2> Introduction </H2>
The 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/cgi-bin/DVTPTP2WWW/view_file.pl?Category=Documents&File=SZSOntology">
SZS ontology</A> provides result and output status values that are used
to correctly and precisely specify properties of problems.
These properties may be of a problem itself, e.g., the conjecture is
a theorem of the axioms, or may be properties established by an ATP system.
<P>
The ontology has recently been extended to include status values for problems
that are unsolved, and to include a more comprehensive set of values describing
the output from an ATP system. 
The latest version is given at the end of this document.

<H2> Why am I Telling You This? </H2>

I seek feedback and comments on the ontologies, hopefully leading to
wider adoption.
As an incentive towards adoption, the
<A HREF="http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/CASC/21/">CASC-21</A> design says ...
<UL>
<LI> The distinguished strings used to report the problem status should use 
     the <A HREF="SZSOntology">SZS ontology</A>, in a line starting 
     "<TT>SZS status</TT>".
     For example:<PRE>
SZS status Unsatisfiable for SYN075+1</PRE>
     or:<PRE>
SZS status GaveUp for SYN075+1</PRE>
<LI> The distinguished strings used to delimit proofs/models should specify
     the precise output form named in the SZS ontology, using lines 
     starting "<TT>SZS output start</TT>" and "<TT>SZS output end</TT>".
     For example:<PRE>
SZS output start CNFRefutation for SYN075-1
  ...
SZS output end CNFRefutation for SYN075-1</PRE>
</UL>
Note the cunning use of "should use", so stubborn people can be accomodated.

The SZS Problem Status Ontology
-------------------------------

The output from current ATP systems varies widely in quantity, quality, and 
meaning.  At the low end of the scale, systems that search for a refutation of 
a set of clauses may output only an assurance that a refutation exists (the 
wonderful "yes" output). At the high end of the scale a system may output a 
natural deduction proof of a problem expressed in FOF. In some cases the 
output is misleading, e.g., when a CNF based system claims that a FOF input 
problem is "unsatisfiable" it typically means that the negated CNF of the 
problem is unsatisfiable.

In order to use ATP systems' results, e.g., as input to other tools, it is 
necessary that the ATP systems correctly and precisely specify what has been 
established. To this end the SZS problem status ontology has been established. 
The ontology was based on initial work done to establish communication 
protocols for systems on the MathWeb Software Bus. The ontology is shown 
below.

The ontology assumes that the input F is of the form Ax => C, where Ax is a 
set (conjunction) of axioms and C is a single conjecture formula. This is a 
common standard usage of ATP systems.
+ The status value indicates the relationship between Ax and C.
+ By showing that F is valid, an ATP system shows that C is a theorem (a 
  logical consequence) of Ax, i.e., Ax |= C, where |= is the standard first 
  order entailment.
+ If F is not valid, there are several other possible relationships between Ax 
  and C, as shown in the ontology.

If F is not of the form Ax => C, it is treated as a single monolithic 
conjecture formula (even if it is an "axiom" or "set of axioms" from the user 
view point). This is equivalent to Ax being TRUE. In this case not all of the 
statuses are appropriate, and those that are possible are marked with a * in 
the ontology.
+ Systems that report Theorem for a monolithic formula must have established 
  Tautology.
+ A set of axioms is treated as a conjecture formed from the conjunction of the 
  formulae.
+ This is the scenario for a set of clauses.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ontology
------------

The solid lines can be followed up the hierarchy as isa links, e.g., an
ETH isa EQV isa (SAT anda THM). The dotted lines can be followed only
once, e.g., a UCA isa UNC, but not a CSA (although UCS isa CAX isa CTH).
The >X< means the >< line tunnels under the X line. 

All status values are expressed as "OneWord" to make system output parsing 
simple, and also have a three letter code. Associated with each possible 
status are the possible outputs from the ATP system. See the explanations 
below to expand the three letter status acronyms to the full meaningful 
status.
